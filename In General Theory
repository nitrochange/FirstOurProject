        <b> Definition: </b> <br>
        Two matrices A and B are equal if all their corresponding entries are equal:<br>
        A = B <=> a<sub>i,j</sub>=b<sub>i,j</sub> for all i, j </p>
    <p>
        <b> Definition: </b> <br>
        The m × n matrix whose entries are all 0 is denoted 0<sub>m,n</sub> (or, more often, justby 0 if the dimensions are obvious from context).
        It’s called the zero matrix.</p>

        <b>Definition:</b> <br>
        If the matrices A and B have the same size, then their sum is the matrix A+B defined by<br>
        (A+B)<sub>i,j</sub>=a<sub>i,j</sub>+b<sub>i,j</sub> <br>
        Their difference is the matrix A−B defined by: <br>
        (A-B)<sub>i,j</sub>=a<sub>i,j</sub>-b<sub>i,j</sub>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Definition:</b>  <br>
        A matrix A can be multiplied by a scalar c to obtain the matrix cA, where <br>
        (cA)<sub>i,j</sub> = c(a<sub>i,j</sub>). <br>
        This is called scalar multiplication. We just multiply each entry of A by c.

        <b> Definition: </b> <br>
        The m × n matrix whose entries are all 0 is denoted 0mn (or, more often, justby 0 if the dimensions are obvious from context).
        It’s called the zero matrix.
